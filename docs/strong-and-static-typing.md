## Strong and static typing

Voxu is a strongly and statically typed language, which means that the type of a variable is known
at compile time, and it cannot be changed at runtime.

This is a very important feature of the language, as it allows the compiler to perform type checking
and type inference, which are very important for the safety of the language.
