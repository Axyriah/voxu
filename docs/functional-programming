## Functional programming

Voxu is a functional programming language. This means it is designed to follow that specific programming
paradigm, which is a programming style that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions
and avoids changing-state and mutable data. It is a declarative programming paradigm, which means programming
is done with expressions or declarations instead of statements. This doesn't mean Voxu wouldn't partially
support imperative programming. It'd be implemented ad-hoc, not being the focus of the language.

This also means that the language is designed to support the most common functional programming concepts,
built-in into the language, such as curried functions, higher-order functions, and lazy evaluation.
