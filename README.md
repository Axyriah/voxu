# 🧊 voxu

A strongly and statically typed, memory-efficient functional programming language.

This is the repository for the compiler, lexical analyzer and parser, and the standard library
for the Voxu programming language. It is worth noting the language itself isn't even near
completion for now, so it is all right to write everything in a different language and then
migrate it to Voxu once it is ready.

It's fair to tell newcorners about the fundamentals, concepts, design decisions, and of course,
the purpose and semantics of Voxu, while it is still in its early stage.

For that reason, this document is written in a way that is easy to understand, and is intended
to become a reference or formal specification of the language as it evolves.

As this is still in its first moments, I would like to hear your feedback and suggestions,
so feel free to contact me at:

- [Discord](https://discord.com/users/273562710745284628)
- [The issues of this repository](https://code.axyria.dev/voxu/issues)

At long last, Voxu is still my first programming language ever, so I'd appreciate any help or
advice anyone can give me, as I love to learn new concepts and listen to feedback.
